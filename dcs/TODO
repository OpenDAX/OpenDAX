OpenDCS To do list

Possibly need to allow the start_module() function to set the processes
environment before launching the module.

Need to have the start_module() function set a lesser UID for the module
before exec()ing the process.  What UID will opendcs run as??? This may not be
the best idea in the world.  It depends on how we wind up signaling the modules.

Fix the dead module queue to be dynamic so that if too many modules die at
once it won't fill up and the system can get cleaned up properly.

Set up the module restarting in the scan_modules() function.

Write the stop_module() function.

Read the configuration file.  What is there to configure yet??
