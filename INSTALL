Basic Installation
==================

OpenDAX uses CMake as the build system generator.  You will need to install
CMake before you can build OpenDAX.  See the CMake documenation
for details on how to install and use it.  https://cmake.org/

Once you have CMake installed you can do a basic installtion with these steps...

Clone the OpenDAX repository from GitHub.

$ git clone https://github.com/OpenDAX/OpenDAX.git

This should create a directory named OpenDAX at the current directory location.

Now configure and build...

$ cd OpenDAX
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
$ sudo make install
$ sudo ldconfig
