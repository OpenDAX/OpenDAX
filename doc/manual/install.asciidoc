=== Installation

OpenDAX uses the CMake build system generator. You’ll need to install
CMake on your system.

You will also need the Lua development libraries installed. Most
distributions have versions of Lua that will work. The currently
supported versions of Lua are 5.3 and greater. If you compile and
install Lua from the source files you will need to add -FPIC compiler
flag to the build.

....
make MYCFLAGS="-fPIC" linux
....

Once you have CMake and the Lua libraries installed you can download and
build OpenDAX. First clone the repository...

....
git clone https://github.com/OpenDAX/OpenDAX.git
....

This should create the OpenDAX directory. Now do the following...

....
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
make test
....

If all the tests pass you can install with …

....
sudo make install
sudo ldconfig
....
