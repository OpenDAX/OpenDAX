/* Notes:
 Okay here is how all this works.  To keep from having to have a buffer for
 each module and to keep from having some arbitrary amount of buffers for 
 new modules we are going to share some buffers.  Each buffer has a file
 descriptor associated with it.  When the socket code decides that it needs
 to read information from a socket it will use these functions to find a buffer
 that is associated with the file descriptor.  If there isn't one associated
 with the file descriptor then it tries to find a free one.  If it can't 
 find a free one then it'll create a new one.  There is a minimum number
 of buffers that will be kept allocated all the time to keep from calling
 malloc() and free() too much.
 
 There will be quite a few denial of service attacks that can be done here
 and I'll have to figure out a way to keep things limping along if some
 socket starts sending data to gum up the works.
