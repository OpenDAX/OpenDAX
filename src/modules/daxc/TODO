Fix tag_write() function to use the number of items passed in the command to determine
how many need to be passed.  The problem with this is that the user may pass more than
can be stored in the tag.  Then the count would have to default to the lower of the two
numbers and the rest of the items typed in the command to be ignored.

Might also allow for '-' to be used to skip a value.  IOW if a user wanted to change the
second and fourth item in an array they could use a command like...
daxc>write TagName[1] 21 - 22
Actually that looks a lot like math so maybe I need to pick another character but it's
the same idea.

Much testing needs to be done.

Use subprocess module in Python to test all the corner cases of writing
and reading.
