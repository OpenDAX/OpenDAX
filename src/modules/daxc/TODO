Fix tag_write() function to use the number of items passed in the command to
determine how many need to be passed.  The problem with this is that the user
may pass more than can be stored in the tag.  Then the count would have to
default to the lower of the two numbers and the rest of the items typed in the
command to be ignored.  This should make the command....

dax> write dummy[8] 0 1 0 1 0 1

...work.

Might also allow for '~' to be used to skip a value.  IOW if a user wanted to
change the second and fourth item in an array they could use a command like...
daxc>write TagName[1] 21 ~ 22

Much testing needs to be done.

Use subprocess module in Python to test all the corner cases of writing
and reading.
