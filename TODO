opendax gets all locked up when a module fails to start

_status tag can be written to by modules.  This should be read only.

Allow 'nice' levels to be set for modules

Much more testing needs to be done.

There is a bug in the event handling logic when multiple modules of the
same name are running.  Somewhere I'm using the name of the module to 
identify it and the name is not forced to be unique.

Also need to remove events when modules are gone.

Test for adding events and maps to tag indexes that do not exist.
